# Testing_MSP430G2
Learning and testing some modules using Launchpads from TI

## Using Make

Compiling using Command Line and make
It is possible to compile projects generated in CSS using command lines. When a new CSS project is created, make files are autogenerated which can be used, for example, to work in your favorite IDE, and compile directly from the terminal with make

__Compile:__
```
make {project_name}.out
```
### __Requirement to Flas the MCU using Command Line__

To burn the mcu, as long as you have a launchpad or another compatible board, the easiest way is to use __Mspdebug__:

```
brew install mspdebug
````

__To flash your mcu:__

mspdebug {your_programming_device} "prog {prog_project_name}.out"

to see the compatible programmers:

```
mspdebug --help
```
For example, to use a launchpad MSP430G2, the device is `rf2500`
